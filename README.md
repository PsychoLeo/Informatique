## Introduction

Hello, my name is Léopold and I am currently (2024) a student at Telecom Paris. I follow the MITRO (theoretical computer science) and ACCQ (applied algebra) courses. I am currently 20 years old. I went through a "prepa" in Stanislas (MPSI, MP*) and studied mostly mathematics, physics and computer science.

I've been programming seriously since 2018, mostly in **Python and C++**. At the beginning (2018-2020), I enjoyed Python and coding little projects, which has since then changed a lot because I prefer competitive programming and solving algorithmical problems using C++. I am currently on MACOS but I used Linux for about 4 years.

## Competitive programming

I participated in many competitive programming contests including :
- **SWERC 2024** (with a team at Telecom Paris)
- Intern contest at Telecom Paris (__2nd__ place)
- Google Hash Code
- Google Code Jam
- Google Kick Start
- **Prologin** (a french CP contest where I went to the finals)
- Algorea
- Codeforces contests

Moreover, I was very active on the french platform **France-IOI** in 2020/2021.
Here is a link to my profile page : http://www.france-ioi.org/user/perso.php?sLogin=leober. I am currently ranked __30th__ on the platform, which I particularly appreciate for its interesting problems, and without which I wouldn't have enjoyed CP so much. My favorite CP subjects are :
- **Segment trees**
- **Mathematical problems (combinatorics, number theory)**
- **Dynamic programming**

What I love me about CP is the search for solutions to problems and optimization, which can be found on a mathematical olympiads page I really like: https://www.mathraining.be/ (where I am in the 2% best of the platform). Figuring out a solution little by little and getting a program that passes all tests is a satisfaction that is difficult to find elsewhere.

In 2020, we set up an algorithmic club at our school with a friend and met regularly by videoconference to implement algorithms or carry out projects (whose source code you can access here). I took over the competitive programming association at Télécom Paris during the 2024/2025 year.

## Structure 


The structure of the Github is the following : 
- **algorithmique** : progression on Codeforces, France IOI, Leetcode, Project Euler and the implementation of some algorithms
- **arduino** : work and little projects realized with arduino
- **autres** : coding certificates for Python, Java, C++ courses. The most valuable one is the MITx online course I did to learn Python3, but there are also a few others from Hackerrank or SoloLearn
- **competitions** : programs submitted within contests such as the ones mentionned before
- **cpp** : little projects and programs made in C++
- **fk-info** : all projects made in our algorithmic club in 2020/2021
- **html** : small folder with HTML web pages
- **java** : java programs for learning classes and OOP
- **lessons** : stuff related to almost every folder mentioned, but only educational content
- **linux** : small folder used when playing around with commands
- **ocaml** : small folder with ocaml files, language I learned during my 2 years in prepa
- **python** : all python work. Is subdivided into : physics simulations, graphics using matplotlib, artificial intelligence, cryptography, games (pygame), AI (sklearn mostly), maths, matplotlib, others, and web related programs
